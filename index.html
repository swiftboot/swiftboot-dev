    <h2>Why Popcorn Exists</h2>
    <p>Traditional OS containers run atop mutable hosts, slow to boot and vulnerable to noisy neighbors and attack surfaces. Popcorn changes that: it <strong>turns your OCI app into the OS</strong>, fusing a minimal kernel with your container into a single bootable binary.</p>

      # 🍿 Why Use Popcorn™

      **Popcorn™ is the fastest, most efficient way to deploy cloud-native applications using microVMs.**

      When milliseconds matter, Popcorn™ delivers.

      ---

      ## 🚀 Instant Boot = Instant Scale

      Popcorn™ fuses your application and kernel into a single bootable image. That means your microVMs go from *cold storage* to *running workload* in **under a second** — no OS boot, no container daemon, no spin-up delay.

      > Your app *pops* the moment it's needed. Perfect for autoscaling, CI/CD, and bursty workloads.

      ---

      ## 🧈 Buttery Smooth Performance

      Unlike containers, Popcorn™ runs on **bare metal microVMs** with **hardware-level isolation** — without sacrificing speed. It’s designed for **zero-jitter cold starts**, **low-latency IO**, and **predictable runtime behavior** across every launch.

      > The result? Fewer surprises. Happier SREs.

      ---

      ## 📦 One Image, All You Need

      Popcorn™ packages:

      - Your **application**
      - A **minimal kernel**
      - An **OCI-compliant root filesystem**

      ...into a single immutable image. No more managing base OS versions or dependencies across environments.

      > Build it once, run it anywhere microVMs run — even air-gapped.

      ---

      ## 🔒 Secure by Construction

      Popcorn™ minimizes your attack surface:

      - No systemd
      - No SSH
      - No package manager
      - No users
      - No legacy drivers
      - No blobs
      - No indigestion
      - No daemons waving backdoor ports
      - No gremlins hiding behind systemd

      Just your app, in a tamper-resistant, read-only image — with full support for measured boot and signed workloads.

      > Fewer moving parts. Fewer exploits.

      ---

      ## 🧮 Smaller. Faster. Cheaper.

      Popcorn™ images are tiny — often **<10MB**, boot in **<1 second**, and use **~4x less memory** than traditional VMs. That translates directly to **lower cloud costs**, higher density, and more responsive workloads.

      > Fit more apps per node. Pay less per workload.

      ---

      ## 🟡 Popcorn™ is what microVMs were meant to be.

      If your team is ready for:

      - Serverless speed
      - VM-grade security
      - Container-like simplicity

      ...then you're ready to pop.

    <h2>🎯 Stakeholders Who Crave Popcorn™</h2>
    <div style="max-height: 800px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1rem; background: #fdfdfd; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap;">
      # 🎯 Stakeholders Who Crave Popcorn™

      Popcorn™ delivers boot-speed infrastructure that satisfies across the stack — from hands-on engineers to high-stakes boardrooms.

      ---

      ## 👩‍💻 Developers

      Popcorn™ clears the clutter: no base image stew, no bloated init, no surprise daemons. Just code that boots like an appliance — fast, clean, and repeatable. CI/CD pipelines simplify. Cold starts evaporate. And devs ship with joy.

      > Your code *is* the system. And it pops.

      ---

      ## 🧭 Product Managers

      Popcorn™ makes environments invisible and delivery reliable. Boot times are sub-second. Environments are reproducible. Rollbacks are just image swaps. Product teams move fast, deploy fearlessly, and sleep better.

      > Fewer war rooms. Faster releases.

      ---

      ## 💰 CFOs

      Popcorn™ cuts your cloud bill. Tiny images, high density, low RAM use, and microVM isolation mean you run more with less. Immutable workloads mean fewer incidents and lower support cost.

      > Spend less per boot. Maximize your margins.

      ---

      ## 🛠️ Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)

      Popcorn™ gives you the trifecta: predictability, observability, and calm. Immutable images boot in milliseconds with no drift, no zombies, no background surprises. Just pure signal.

      > Fewer incidents. More uptime. No midnight gremlins.

      ---

      ## 🧑‍💼 CEOs

      Popcorn™ simplifies your platform story: fewer tools, fewer vendors, and a unified infrastructure that moves with your business. Security, velocity, and operational confidence — baked in.

      > Infrastructure becomes a strategic asset.

      ---

      ## 🪑 Board of Directors

      Popcorn™ reduces attack surface, eliminates drift, and enables verifiable supply chains. Immutable, signed images plus measured boot give auditors and compliance teams hard guarantees — not wishful thinking.

      > Reduced risk. Cleaner governance. Shareholder confidence.

      ---

      ## 🔒 CISOs / Security Teams

      Popcorn™ has no package managers, no SSH, no users, and no daemon ports. It’s secure by construction with zero-runtime attack surface. Boot integrity is provable. Attestation is simple.

      > Security isn't an afterthought — it's a kernel feature.

      ---

      ## 🧾 Compliance & Risk Officers

      Popcorn™ reduces the compliance blast radius. Workloads are immutable, auditable, and versioned. That means easier attestations, cleaner logs, and fewer policy exceptions.

      > Shorter audits. Smaller scopes. Fewer surprises.

      ---

      ## ⚙️ Platform Engineers

      Popcorn™ is the foundation you've always wanted: reproducible, bootable, pre-tested workloads with zero base OS maintenance. Golden images, made real.

      > From snowflakes to snapshots. Your platform, distilled.

      ---

      ## 💡 Innovation Leads / R&D

      Popcorn™ is perfect for rapid iteration — lightweight images, instant boot, easy teardown. Build, test, ship, discard. Explore freely without cloud waste.

      > Lab speed at prod scale.

      ---

      ## 🌐 Edge & IoT Ops

      Popcorn™ boots anywhere — fast. Whether it's a factory edge node or a solar-powered station in the desert, Popcorn's tiny size and deterministic boot make it ideal for constrained and remote environments.

      > Minimal power. Max reliability.

      ---

      ## 📦 DevOps & Release Engineering

      Popcorn™ eliminates flaky deployments. Every image is a sealed unit: app, kernel, rootfs — no drift, no missing deps. Build once, ship everywhere, and debug almost never.

      > Artifacts you can trust.

      ---

      ## 🖥️ IT / Desktop Ops

      Boot dev environments or internal sandboxes instantly, with no config drift and no full OS installs. Perfect for secure laptops, hackathons, and air-gapped labs.

      > No reimaging. Just re-popping.

      ---

      ## 🌍 Sustainability / Green IT

      Popcorn™ uses fewer resources: faster boots, lower memory, higher density. That translates to less energy use and better carbon efficiency at scale.

      > Run leaner. Boot greener.
